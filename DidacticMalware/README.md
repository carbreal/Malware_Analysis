# Didactic Malware
I have developed this malware sample in order to test some Linux EDRs. It is intended to be simple, easy and do its job.
The code is poorly written and there are A LOT of improvements that could be made. At the time, I don't need it to be super functional, complex or undetectable. Just simple.

##ARCHITECTURE
The Architecture is very simple. A DNS server, a server to host the sample and the C2. For the DNS server, you can set up a Bind server and for the C2 and host server, a simple apache2 or python SimpleHTTPServer will do the trick.

I quickly started 3 VMs in AWS and the Victim, and in 5 minutes you can have everything working. FYI, it's not up anymore ^^

##Features
At the moment, the malware just has 4 simple options, execute a command, update a setting, sleep or terminate the process. It reads a b64 text that has to have the action+command. For example, in order to execute the whoami command, the HTTP server should have the following content: echo -n "exec whoami" | base64 -w0 -> ZXhlYyB3aG9hbWk=
The output of the command will be sent via DNS requests to the DNS server.

##Debug
The malware writes every action in a log file in order to debug or know what's happening.

##Persistence
It copies itself in a hidden folder in a location that has writting permissions and gains persistence editing the crontab. Everything very simple.
